# Hebrew Wordle - Automated Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive automated testing strategy for the Hebrew Wordle game to ensure all game logic, statistics tracking, progress persistence, and UI interactions work correctly from start to finish.

## Testing Framework Recommendations

### 1. Unit Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Setup**: Already available in Create React App
- **Coverage**: Game logic, statistics calculations, utility functions

### 2. Integration Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **Coverage**: Game state management, localStorage integration, dialog interactions

### 3. End-to-End Testing (Cypress or Playwright)
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows
- **Coverage**: Full game sessions, statistics accuracy, settings persistence

## Test Categories

### A. Game Logic Tests

#### Word Validation & Feedback
```javascript
describe('Word Validation', () => {
  test('should accept valid Hebrew words')
  test('should reject invalid words')
  test('should provide correct letter feedback (correct, present, absent)')
  test('should handle duplicate letters correctly')
  test('should validate word length')
})
```

#### Game State Management
```javascript
describe('Game State', () => {
  test('should initialize game with correct default state')
  test('should track current guess and attempt number')
  test('should detect win conditions correctly')
  test('should detect loss conditions (6 attempts)')
  test('should prevent input after game ends')
  test('should handle game reset properly')
})
```

### B. Statistics Tracking Tests

#### Game Statistics
```javascript
describe('Game Statistics', () => {
  test('should increment gamesPlayed on game completion')
  test('should increment gamesWon only on wins')
  test('should calculate win percentage correctly')
  test('should track current streak accurately')
  test('should update max streak when current exceeds it')
  test('should reset current streak on loss')
  test('should update guess distribution correctly')
  test('should handle edge cases (first game, perfect streak)')
})
```

#### Statistics Persistence
```javascript
describe('Statistics Persistence', () => {
  test('should save stats to localStorage on update')
  test('should load stats from localStorage on app start')
  test('should handle missing localStorage data gracefully')
  test('should clear stats when reset button is clicked')
})
```

### C. Progress Tracking Tests

#### Category Progress
```javascript
describe('Category Progress', () => {
  test('should track completed words per category')
  test('should show category completion dialog when all words done')
  test('should persist progress across sessions')
  test('should reset progress when requested')
  test('should handle multiple categories correctly')
})
```

#### Word Selection
```javascript
describe('Word Selection', () => {
  test('should not repeat completed words')
  test('should select from remaining words in category')
  test('should handle category completion correctly')
  test('should switch categories when current is complete')
})
```

### D. UI Interaction Tests

#### Keyboard Input
```javascript
describe('Keyboard Interaction', () => {
  test('should accept Hebrew letter input')
  test('should handle backspace correctly')
  test('should submit guess on Enter')
  test('should ignore invalid keys')
  test('should disable input when game is over')
})
```

#### Dialog Management
```javascript
describe('Dialog Management', () => {
  test('should show success dialog on win')
  test('should show category completion dialog when appropriate')
  test('should show statistics dialog when requested')
  test('should show settings dialog when requested')
  test('should close dialogs properly')
  test('should handle overlay clicks correctly')
})
```

### E. Settings & Persistence Tests

#### Settings Management
```javascript
describe('Settings', () => {
  test('should save theme preference')
  test('should save difficulty settings')
  test('should persist settings across sessions')
  test('should apply settings correctly on load')
  test('should reset settings when requested')
})
```

#### Data Migration
```javascript
describe('Data Migration', () => {
  test('should handle old localStorage format gracefully')
  test('should migrate data to new format when needed')
  test('should not lose user progress during updates')
})
```

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Game Logic (Week 1)
1. Set up Jest testing environment
2. Write unit tests for word validation
3. Test game state management
4. Test win/loss detection

### Phase 2: Statistics System (Week 2)
1. Test statistics calculations
2. Test localStorage integration
3. Test statistics display components
4. Test statistics reset functionality

### Phase 3: Progress Tracking (Week 3)
1. Test category progress tracking
2. Test word selection logic
3. Test progress persistence
4. Test category completion flow

### Phase 4: UI Integration (Week 4)
1. Test keyboard interactions
2. Test dialog management
3. Test settings persistence
4. Test responsive design

### Phase 5: End-to-End Testing (Week 5)
1. Set up Cypress/Playwright
2. Create complete game session tests
3. Test statistics accuracy over multiple games
4. Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Word Lists
- Create test catalogs with known words
- Include edge cases (duplicate letters, common patterns)
- Test with different word lengths if applicable

### Mock Data
- Sample game statistics for testing calculations
- Various game states for testing UI
- Different progress states for testing category completion

### Test Scenarios
- New user (no localStorage data)
- Returning user with existing progress
- User with completed categories
- User with various streak scenarios

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Test Runs
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on pull requests
- Run E2E tests on staging deployments
- Generate coverage reports

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All tests must pass before merge
- Performance benchmarks for game logic
- Accessibility testing for UI components

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Test Maintenance
- Review and update tests with new features
- Monitor test execution times
- Update test data as game content changes
- Regular review of test coverage

### Bug Prevention
- Add regression tests for fixed bugs
- Test edge cases discovered in production
- Validate game balance and difficulty
- Monitor user feedback for testing gaps

## Tools & Setup Commands

### Install Testing Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event
npm install --save-dev cypress
# or
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report
npm run cypress:open       # E2E tests (interactive)
npm run cypress:run        # E2E tests (headless)
```

### Test File Structure
